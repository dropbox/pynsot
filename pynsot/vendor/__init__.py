"""
This is a pseudo module that allows you to proxy imports. This lets you
import dependencies in the form `from .vendor import requests`. We provide
a hook through the environment variable _PYNSOT_PYTHONPATH to override
the path for `pynsot` dependencies, otherwise it uses sys.path by default.

There is a limitation with dependencies that use absolute imports in their
packages as they will not be imported under the pynsot.vendor namespace.
